        The History.replaceState() method modifies the current history 
        entry, replacing it with the state object and URL passed in the 
        method parameters. This method is particularly useful when you 
        want to update the state object or URL of the current history 
        entry in response to some user action.
        
        replaceState(stateObj, title, url)
        stateObj can be null, title is traditionally left "" (it's not
        in use at the moment) and url is the new url.

        // This is the same but creates a new history entry instead of 
        // replacing an old one.
        pushState(stateObj, title, url)


        This does not redirect.
        Needs a http server to work, it seems! GitHub Pages ok, for instance.
