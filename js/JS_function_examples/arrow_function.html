<h1>Using "this" in regular and arrow functions</h1>

Regular functions the this keyword represented the object that called the function, which could be the window, the document, a button or whatever.

With arrow functions the this keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function.

<p>This example demonstrate that in a regular function, the "this" keyword represents different objects depending on how the function was called.</p>

<p>Click the button to execute the "hello" function again, and you will see that this time "this" represents the button object.</p>

<button id="btn">Click Me!</button>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
function hello() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += this;
}



//The window object calls the function:
window.addEventListener("load", hello);

//A button object calls the function:
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", hello);
</script>
