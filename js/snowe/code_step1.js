// NOTE: some features in the code here are from ECMAScript 6 (ES6)
//(the newest JavaScript standard from 6/2015) and only work
// in browsers supporting it (practically the most modern
// browsers do but no version of IE, for instance).
// Examples of the new notation: class, constructor, const, let
