<h1>How to get going with Github and Atom</h1>

<p>
  An online version management system makes your life
  a lot easier. Specially if you want to work on
  different computers, share your code with others or
  collaborate with other persons on a project.
</p>


<p>Follow the steps below: </p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Create an account on  <a href="https://github.com"
    target=" blank">Github</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create a new repository (select
    <u>Initialize this repository with a README</u>!).
  </li>
  <li>
    Download <a href="https://desktop.github.com"
    target=" blank">GitHub Desktop</a>
    to your computer and install it (no admin rights needed).
  </li>
  <li>
    Open GitHub Desktop, sign in and Clone the right
    repository (default location in Documents is ok).
    After that you can quit GitHub Desktop.
  </li>
  <li>
    Atom: File -> Open Folder and select the <u>the
    cloned repository (folder)</u>. And there you are!
    The work flow goes like this (every lesson):<br><br>

    a) <b>Fetch</b> -> <b>Pull</b> (to update the local version) <br>
    b) Edit your code and test it locally <br>
    c) <b>Stage</b> and <b>Commit</b> (give a message for Commit)<br>
    d) <b>Push</b> (asks for your GitHub username & password)
  </li>

</ol>

<p>
  After these steps you always have the newest version of
  your code both online and on your computer!
