# To do (students): 
1. **Pull** this repository (or the latest changes) to your computer. 
2. Create a database *db_mynotes* with tables *id* (int, primary key, autoincrement) and *content* (text): use **EasyPHP -> PhpMyAdmin** 
3. Implement CRUD operations (partially together with the teacher). 

    * **Create** and **Read**: together with teacher
    * **Update**: try to do it more on your own. Note: you must *transfer the note_id* to know which note to edit.
    * **Delete**: Ask for confirmation before deletion. Start by creating a *Delete* button in home.html.
    * When everything works, **push** your work to the cloud.
4. Take four screenshots of the **home** view in the following situations: 
    * after having added a few notes
    * after having changed one of the notes
    * after having clicked on the Delete button (confirmation view)
    * after having deleted the first note

    Save them to the **images** folder and **add image links** to the end of this document.

Note: if something does not work (despite your best efforts), add a comment about it below.
