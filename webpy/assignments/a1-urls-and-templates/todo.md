# To do (students): 
1. **Pull** this repository (or the latest changes) to your computer. It's possible to work online but locally you can use an editor of your choice and testing is easier.
3. Add a third page **school.html** with variables *myclass* and *school_name* to the templates.
4. Add *links* to the three pages so that you can go to all other pages from each page.
5. Add some *content* to the school.html where you *use the variables* myclass and school_name.
6. Add the needed code to **app.py** to make everything work.
7. When everything works, **push** your work to the cloud.
