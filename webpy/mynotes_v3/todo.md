# To do (students): 
1. **Pull** this repository (or the latest changes) to your computer. 
2. Add two new tables **users** and **sessions** to the db *db_mynotes* in *EasyPHP -> PhpMyAdmin*. To make it easy use the SQL queries in **schema.sql**

3. Implement the following features:
    * sign up (saving a new user to the db)
    * login (sessions)
    * logout (sessions)

    Make sure the logged in user stays logged in also if she adds a note or reloads a page.


4. Take four screenshots of the following situations: 
    * a
    * b
    * c
    * d

    Save them to the **images** folder and **add image links** to the end of this document.

Note: if something does not work (despite your best efforts), add a comment about it below.
