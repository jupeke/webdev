# To do (students): 
1. **Pull** this repository (or the latest changes) to your computer. 
3. Change the **form-and-data** project in the following way:
a) Add *links* to the three pages so that you can go to all other pages from each page.
b) Add some *content* to the school.html where you *use the variables* myclass and school_name.
c) Add the needed code to **app.py** to make everything work.
4. When everything works, **push** your work to the cloud.
